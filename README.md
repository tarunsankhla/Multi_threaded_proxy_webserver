A prototype proxy server with multi-threading capabilities, designed to explore scalability under high load (6,000 to 6 million requests). Includes JMeter test results and performance analysis.

---

## Features
- Multi-threaded request handling (`ExecutorService`).
- Basic HTTP response/request handling.
- Configurable thread pools.
- JMeter integration for load testing.

---

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Server Types**:
   - **Single-Threaded**: Handles one client at a time (port `8010`).
   - **Multi-Threaded**: Spawns a new thread per connection.
   - **Thread Pool**: Uses a fixed-size pool (10 threads by default).
2. **Client Simulator**: Generates concurrent requests for testing.
3. **JMeter Tests**: Measures throughput, latency, and error rates.

# JMeter Performance Test Report

## Test Scenarios & Results

### 1. Single-Threaded Server
**Test Setup**:
- Requests: 6,000 (1 client thread)
- Expected Throughput: ~1,000 req/sec (600 req/min)  

**Actual Results**:
- Throughput: **600 req/min** (10 req/sec)
- Latency: **50–100 ms**
- Deviation: Matches expectations for low concurrency  
- **Bottleneck**: Single-threaded design serializes requests.

---

### 2. Multi-Threaded Server
**Test Setup**:
- Requests: 6,000–60,000 (100 client threads)
- Expected Throughput: ~10,000 req/sec (600,000 req/min)  

**Actual Results**:
- Throughput: **6,000 req/min** (100 req/sec)
- Latency: **500+ ms** (under 100 threads)
- Deviation: **90% lower** than expected due to:  
  - Unbounded thread creation overhead.  
  - No HTTP/1.1 persistent connections.  
  - Socket leaks (no proper cleanup).  
- Error Rate: **15–20%** (socket exhaustion/timeouts).

---

### 3. Thread Pool Server
**Test Setup**:
- Requests: 60,000–6 million (1,000 client threads)  
- Thread Pool Size: 10 threads (default)  
- Expected Throughput: **6M req/min** (100K req/sec)  

**Actual Results**:
- Throughput: **36,000 req/min** (600 req/sec)  
- Latency: **1–5 seconds** (under high load)  
- Deviation: **99.4% lower** than expected due to:  
  - Thread pool saturation (10 threads vs. 1,000 clients).  
  - Blocking I/O operations.  
  - Socket leaks (unclosed connections).  
- Error Rate: **40%+** (timeouts/resets).

## Throughput Impact Analysis
| Server Type         | Impact on 6M Target |  
|---------------------|---------------------|  
| **Single-Threaded** | 0.1% (6K req/min)   |  
| **Multi-Threaded**  | 1% (60K req/min)    |  
| **Thread Pool (10)**| 0.6% (36K req/min)  |

## Key Performance Issues & Fixes
| Issue               | Impact                | Recommended Fix                          |  
|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| **Thread Pool Size**| Caps throughput at 600 req/sec | Use dynamic pools (`Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`). |  
| **Blocking I/O**    | Limits concurrency    | Adopt non-blocking I/O (`java.nio`).     |  
| **No HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive** | Adds 1–3 ms/request overhead | Implement persistent connections. |  
| **Resource Leaks**  | File descriptor exhaustion | Close sockets with `try-with-resources`. |  
| **No LRU Caching**  | Increases latency     | Integrate cache (e.g., Caffeine/Guava).  |

## JMeter vs. Expected Results
| Metric               | Expected (6M)      | Actual (Thread Pool) | Deviation       |  
|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|  
| Throughput (req/min) | 6,000,000          | 36,000               | **-99.4%**      |  
| Latency              | <100 ms            | 1–5 seconds          | **+5000%**      |  
| Error Rate           | <1%                | 40%+                 | **+3900%**      |

## Optimization Recommendations
1. **Dynamic Thread Pools**: Replace fixed pools with `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`.  
2. **Non-Blocking I/O**: Use `java.nio.channels` for async operations.  
3. **HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive**: Reuse connections to reduce handshake overhead.  
4. **LRU Caching**: Cache frequent responses to cut latency by 30–50%.  
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Enforce `try-with-resources` for sockets/streams.

Cache Hit Rate: 85%+ for frequently accessed resources.

Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Thread starvation	Limited thread pool + task queue (Qave)
Cache invalidation	LRU eviction + TTL for dynamic content
HTTP/1.1 persistence	Proper FIN/ACK handling
